  - On July 15, 1952, the Grand Museum opened its doors for the first time,  bringing
    the old Allison mansion back to life with a new coat of paint. According to Kevin
    Allison, local businessman and the mind behind this grand reopening, this new
    business venture was sure to attract tourists and help bring new life to our
    small town.
  - Sadly, only a week later, Kevin Allison passed away in a strange accident, and
    the future of the museum is currently unknown.
