  - In the last few weeks, three different people have disappeared in the whereabouts
    of that old museum outside of town. We need to find out what is going on, and
    fast.
  - No one else is available, so it's up to you, detective. Go in there and take
    a look, see if there's anything strange happening. Good luck.
