# XP4-Unity

./Survival Horror contains the Unity / game stuff.

./Docs constains (at least for now) some txt files to document important things.

Right now the main scene is located at Assets/Scenes/World.



WASD controls the character, it has tanks controls so W is always 'forward' the character's perspective.

F is the interaction button.

Tab opens/closes the inventory.

RMB to select options/items.
