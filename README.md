# Project Unkown

./Survival Horror contains the Unity / game stuff, open this on the Unity Hub to add the project

./Docs contains (at least for now) some txt files to document important things.

./Docs/TechnicalDocuments has some guides on how to add new content and also gives a brief description on how the code is structured (this is not finished yet)

Right now the main scene is located at Assets/Scenes/World.


# Controls

WASD controls the character, it has tanks controls so W is always 'forward' from the character's perspective.

F is the interaction button.

Tab opens/closes the inventory.

LMB to select options/items.
