>> TO DO

If the player has no empty space on the inventory, does not show the pickup overlay.
if (hasSpace) { code_here }
hasSpace is for loop checking if there is empty

Inventory -> use/equip, discard, inspect

Cleanup, there are some stuff on scripts and in the assets folder that arent being used

(Maybe) use Enums to store room data: Unexplored -> Partially explored -> Explored

Enemy movement

Finish pistol script (shoot raycast searching for the "Enemy" tag, then deal damage)

Health and recovery system

Make the Equip method a delegate to be more flexible

Fix inconsistent player speed

Inspect item - breif description, manipulate the 3D model, find hidden parts, etc (low priority rn)
 
>> DONE

Block interaction while inventory is being shown (apply playerBlocked on the interact method)
Also blocked inventory if text is being shown too

Equip item (need to improve the script later on)

For better UI readability the pistol on the inventory must show how many bullets are loaded

Fix number not updating (disappearing) when the item is set to empty (reload method)

Shoot and reload script (no timers were implemented tho) 

On "Spawn" unlocking the player movement is causing issues, the bug is probably on "TankMovement"

Implement the DestroyedItems logic on the puzzles so they dont reset when the scene reloads

Scene data now has its own class, WorldVars

"CollectableController" should be replaced by COL on the GameManager prefab and fix some naming mistakes

Scene change -> save and load inventory state

Fix cant collect second ammo
pass the gameobject as an argument and call only the function belonging to that gameobject

Use the Icon prefab i created on the UI folder, not the one on the scene.

New screen similar to PickupOverlay to show dialoge, like (This can't be used here. The door was unlocked. Etc)

Use playerVars to determine how much of each item the player has on the inventory. (used a list instead)

Fix massive lag spike when loading the text font for the first time

Save game manager, PickupOverlay and InventoryController as one prefab

Make caracter uncontrollabe when any menu/ui stuff is on screen
