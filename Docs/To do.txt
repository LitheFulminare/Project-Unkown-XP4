Use playerVars to determine how much of each item the player has on the inventory.
I should have used scriptable objects, but it's too late and I'm lazy.

If the player has no empty space on the inventory, does not show the pickup overlay.
if (hasSpace) { code_here }
hasSpace is for loop checking if there is empty

Fix cant collect second ammo
pass the gameobject as an argument and call only the function belonging to that gameobject

Make caracter uncontrollabe while pickup overlay and inventory are on screen
