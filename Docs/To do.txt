>> TO DO

Use playerVars to determine how much of each item the player has on the inventory.
I should have used scriptable objects, but it's too late and I'm lazy.

If the player has no empty space on the inventory, does not show the pickup overlay.
if (hasSpace) { code_here }
hasSpace is for loop checking if there is empty

Make caracter uncontrollabe while pickup overlay and inventory are on screen

Inventory -> use, discard, inspect (not needed now)

New screen similar to PickupOverlay to show dialoge, like (This can't be used here. The door was unlocked. Etc)

>> DONE

Fix cant collect second ammo
pass the gameobject as an argument and call only the function belonging to that gameobject

Use the Icon prefab i created on the UI folder, not the one on the scene.
I'd have to manually set all images in every icon, whuch I dont wanna do.
