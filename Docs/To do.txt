>> TO DO

If the player has no empty space on the inventory, does not show the pickup overlay.
if (hasSpace) { code_here }
hasSpace is for loop checking if there is empty

Block interaction while inventory is being shown

Rn the scene data is on PlayerVars, but it'd made more sense if it had its own class

Inventory -> use, discard, inspect (not needed now)

"CollectableController" should be replaced by COL on the GameManager prefab and fix some naming mistakes

Implement the DestroyedItems logic on the puzzles so they dont reset when the scene reloads

On "Spawn" unlocking the player movement is causing issues, the bug is probably on "TankMovement"

Cleanup, there are some stuff on scripts and in the assets folder that arent being used
 
>> DONE

Fix cant collect second ammo
pass the gameobject as an argument and call only the function belonging to that gameobject

Use the Icon prefab i created on the UI folder, not the one on the scene.

New screen similar to PickupOverlay to show dialoge, like (This can't be used here. The door was unlocked. Etc)

Use playerVars to determine how much of each item the player has on the inventory. (used a list instead)

Scene change -> save and load inventory state

Fix massive lag spike when loading the text font for the first time

Save game manager, PickupOverlay and InventoryController as one prefab

Make caracter uncontrollabe when any menu/ui stuff is on screen
