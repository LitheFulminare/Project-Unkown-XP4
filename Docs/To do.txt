>> TO DO

If the player has no empty space on the inventory, does not show the pickup overlay.
if (hasSpace) { code_here }
hasSpace is for loop checking if there is empty

Make caracter uncontrollabe when any menu/ui stuff is on screen

Inventory -> use, discard, inspect (not needed now)

Scene change -> save and load inventory state

>> DONE

Fix cant collect second ammo
pass the gameobject as an argument and call only the function belonging to that gameobject

Use the Icon prefab i created on the UI folder, not the one on the scene.

New screen similar to PickupOverlay to show dialoge, like (This can't be used here. The door was unlocked. Etc)

Use playerVars to determine how much of each item the player has on the inventory. (used a list instead)

Fix massive lag spike when loading the text font for the first time
