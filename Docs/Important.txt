This covers the asset side of things, setting up the rendering to match PS1 is a whole different beast.

The bit depth of the game's color is still 32-bit, to drop it down to 16-bit in Unity you would have to render out to a render texture set to RGB565 as its format and display that on the screen. Dropping the render texture's resolution to 256x224 with it also set to point filtering would give the full look.

Then you need to emulate the non-perspective corrected texture filtering, vertex wobble, and lack of per-pixel lighting which means lots of time writing shaders.

The last part of the asset that you would also do for a full PS1 look is baking the lighting to vertex colors since even realtime vertex lighting was expensive. You could paint these by hand in your modelling program or write an editor script to do it for you.

Some tips I can give you are as follows:
- Play with lighting. The PS1 had trouble with real-time lighting. Therefore, most lighting was done using texture trickery instead of real lighting.
- Low poly models. Use very low-quality models with as little detail as possible. Try to use textures for detailing instead of the 3d model.
- Low-quality textures. When importing a texture into Unity, you can compress the size in the Unity editor. Compressing the size makes the file smaller, but also reduces the quality. It is an easy way of getting low-texture images. When setting the Filter Mode to point, you get more pixelated textures.
- Lower the aspect ratio. You can set a fixed aspect ratio in Unity for your game. By setting a lower aspect ratio, everything will be of lower quality as you lower the amount of pixels that can be visible.
- Use a Render Texture. It is possible to render a camera on a texture in Unity. You can then fill the screen with this texture as a UI element. Applying effects on this texture using the Unity shader graph is fairly easy. Also, you can decrease the render texture its size, making everything look more pixelated (just like lowering the aspect ratio).
