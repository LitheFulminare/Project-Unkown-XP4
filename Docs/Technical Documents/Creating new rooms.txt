I recommend analyzing by youself how the hierarchy is structured before following the instructions
Be sure the hierarchy is well organize and follow the convention. A room can be duplicate to make this process easier

-> Add 'GameManager' prefab

-> Add 'Player' prefab

-> Adding doors
	-> Name them whatever you want but add their destination between parenthesis to make things easier
	-> Add 'Interactable' and 'Door' scripts as components
	-> Interactable component -> if you want the door to be unlocked withou needing to do a puzzle, check 'Puzzle Complete' 
				  -> if the player needs an item to unlock the door, select the item in the 'Needed item' field
				  -> add door component in the 'Door' field
			          -> add the player in 'Player_interaction' field
	-> Door Component -> add the 'GameManager' in the 'SceneChanger' field
	                  -> write the name of the scene the door leads to
			  -> write the index of where in the room the player must spawn

- Adding player spawns
	-> Add the Original spawn position
	-> Add a spawn for each door. Set them as children of the door they belong so it's easier to read
	-> Add them on the 'Spawns' list on 'SceneChanger' component, 'GameManager' prefab
	-> Write the spawn index between parenthesis on their name

-> Adding cameras
	-> The cameras themselves should be on the fbx scene
	-> Duplicate 'Trigger zone' and set its virtual camera as the scene camera
	-> Ajust the 'Box Collider' size and make sure 'Is Trigger' is checked
	-> Add the player in the 'Player' field on the 'Camera Switch' component, 'Trigger zone' object
	
-> Adding collectables (if you want to create new collectables, refer to "Creating new items" file)
	-> They are located in Prefabs/Collectables
	-> Just add them where you want, no further actions are needed here

-> Saving the scene data
	-> Go to the 'GameManager' prefab and edit the 'World Vars' script
		-> Add lists for the collected items and completed puzzles
		-> Add the scene name on the switch statement on the save and load methods
